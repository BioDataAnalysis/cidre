function model = cidre(source, varargin)
% Illumination correction for optical microscopy. Apply to a collection of 
% monochromatic images. Multi-channel images should be separated, and each 
% channel corrected separately.
% 
% Usage:  MODEL = cidre(source, ...)
%
% Input:  SOURCE can be a path to a folder containing images, a path with a
%                filter (eg "/images/*.tif"), or an RxCxN array containing 
%                the images to be corrected (R = height, C = width, N = 
%                number of images).
%
%                CIDRE also supports the following optional arguments,
%                which override default parameters.
%       
%         'destination' specifies a folder where corrected images and 
%                correction model are stored. If empty, CIDRE will return a
%                model but not store corrected images.
%       
%         'correction_mode' (default = 2) specifies the type of correction
%                to perform:  0 "Zero-light preserved" retains the original 
%                intensity range and zero-light level of the original 
%                images. 1 "Dynamic range corrected" retains the intensity 
%                range of the original images. 2 "Direct" subtracts the 
%                zero-light term and divides the illumination gain. 
%
%         'lambda_v' (default = 6.0) high values (eg. 9.5) increase the
%                spatial regularization strength, yielding a more smooth v
%                intensity gain surface.
%
%         'lambda_z' (default = 0.5) high values (eg. 3) increase the
%                zero-light regularization strength, enforcing a more
%                uniform z surface.
%
%         'z_limits' (default none) user may specify known limits for the z
%                z surface, using dark frame images for example. Specify
%                the limits as a 2-element array (e.g. 'z_limits',[98 105])
%
%         'bit_depth' specifies the bit depth of the images to be correct.
%                The bit depth is automatically detected, only use this
%                option if the detection fails.
%
%          'q_percent' (default = 0.25) specifies the proportion of the 
%                data used to compute the robust mean, Q.
%
%          'max_lbfgs_iterations' (default = 500) specifies the maximum
%                number of iterations allowed in the optimization.
%
% Output: MODEL  a structure containing the correction model used by CIDRE
%                to correct the source images
%
