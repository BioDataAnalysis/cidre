function cidre(source, varargin)
% A general illumination correction method for optical microscopy. Should
% be applied to collections of images. Images must be monochromatic. Multi-
% channel images should be separated and each channel corrected separately.
% 
% Usage:  MODEL = cidre(source, ...)
%
% Input:  SOURCE can be a path to a folder containing images, a path with a
%                filter (eg "/images/*.tif"), or an RxCxZ array containing 
%                the images to be corrected (R = height, C = width, Z = 
%                number of images).
%
%                Optional arguments pairs can override default parameters.
%
% Output: MODEL  a structure containing the correction model used by CIDRE
%
