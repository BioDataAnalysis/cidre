CIDRE
=====

About
-----
CIDRE is a general illumination correction method for optical microscopy. It is designed to correct collections of images by building a model of the illumination distortion directly from the image data. Larger image collections provide more robust corrections. Details of the method are described in [].

Contents
--------
This project contains several folders:

- ``matlab`` a standalone Matlab implementation of CIDRE with a GUI interface.

- ``compiled`` a compiled executable of the Matlab standalone that runs without a Matlab installation.

- ``imagej``  an ImageJ plugin implementation of CIDRE.


Installation
------------

To install the ImageJ plugin, simply copy `Cidre_Plugin.jar` to the plugins folder of your ImageJ or Fiji installation. For instructions on how to use the Matlab implementation, add the CIDRE/matlab folder to your path and type `help cidre`.
